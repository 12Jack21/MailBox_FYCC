Hi!<br><br>
vgold is ready for online transactions! Send vgold to any other member for only 1 percent fee. vgold is a form of electronic gold and represents how much gold you own. Unlike credits, vgold represents a real stock and can be exchanged to PayPal for the current gold to USD exchange rate. vgold can also be purchased with PayPal. The total amount of vgold in the system is calculated every day and converted to real gold using the GoldPass application. To buy credits with the gold, there is a form on the buy credits page or it is possible to buy through the exchange. To find out more please visit vagex.com/members/vgold and also vagex.com/info#11 to read the vgold information and rules.<br><br>
